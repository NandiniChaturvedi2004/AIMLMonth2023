Summary(Optional) :   I made a project on the data - Honda Cars Model Resale. I answered the questions of the task 1 in the best way possible for me. For task 2 , I used Linear regression but the results I obtained , i.e. the training score and the test score were not satisfactory. Therefore, I further used Random Forest Regressor to get better results.At last , I also plotted a scattered plot between the actual and predicted value of the 'Price' of the cars.
